                        <p className='text-gray-400 text-justify'>TMichael B. Jordan’s new movie version of The Thomas Crown Affair will be hoping for a big score in early 2027.

Amazon MGM Studios is set to release the heist film theatrically and in IMAX on March 5, 2027. Jordan directs and stars alongside Taylor Russell in the feature that follows Norman Jewison’s 1968 original of the same name starring Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway.

Drew Pearce (The Fall Guy) wrote the script for the new movie after Wes Tooke and Justin Britt-Gibson penned a previous draft. Serving as producers are Patrick McCormick and Marc Toberoff, while Jordan produces for his banner Outlier Society alongside Elizabeth Raposo. Alan Trustman, writer of the original film, executive produces.

The original Thomas Crown Affair landed two Oscar nominations and tells the story of an insurance investigator working to track down the perpetrator of a bank heist. It was remade in 1999, with the updated version starring Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo.</p>

                        <p className='text-gray-400 text-justify'>A judge has thrown out a lawsuit challenging Warner Bros.’ copyright to “Superman” in 10 countries, finding that the federal courts have no jurisdiction over the dispute.

Mark Peary, the nephew of late “Superman” co-creator Joe Shuster, sued the studio and its DC Comics subsidiary in January, arguing that Shuster’s estate had a right to cancel “Superman” copyrights in the United Kingdom, Canada, Ireland, and other territories.

In a ruling on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman held that the court has no authority to address the estate’s rights under foreign laws.

“The Court concludes that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over this case; the case therefore must be and is dismissed,” Furman wrote.

Undeterred, Peary filed a nearly identical lawsuit on Friday morning in state court in New York. The state suit seeks an injunction that could, in theory, interfere with the July 11 release of “Superman,” the franchise...</p>

                        <p className='text-gray-400 text-justify'>1989's "Batman" made Tim Burton a box office hero, exposed mass audiences to a truly dark interpretation of the Dark Knight, and ensured Joker actor Jack Nicholson never ran out of money for the rest of his life. The movie was a major success, changing how Hollywood marketed blockbuster movies going forward and influencing every single superhero movie that came in its wake. Burton himself is a big part of why the movie worked as well as it did, holding fast to his artistic vision for the character even as Warner Bros. tried to steer him away from it at multiple turns. But we also wouldn't have that vision without Sam Hamm and Warren Skaaren's script, which contains some of the most memorable lines in superhero movie history, from Joker's "Where does he get those wonderful toys?" to Michael Keaton's legendary "I'm Batman."Interestingly enough, that script took...</p>
