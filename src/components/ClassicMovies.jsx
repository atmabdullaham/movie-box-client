      <div className="text-lg font-black">12 Angry Men</div>
      Directed by Sidney Lumet, 12 Angry Men is a gripping courtroom drama that unfolds entirely in a jury room, where twelve men deliberate the fate of a teenage boy accused of murder. Initially convinced of his guilt, the jurors are forced to confront their own prejudices and assumptions as one man begins to question the evidence. With a minimalist setting and a powerhouse performance by Henry Fonda, the film is a masterclass in tension, character development, and moral reasoning. It remains a profound exploration of justice, doubt, and human behavior.
